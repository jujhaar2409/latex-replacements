# latex-replacements-macos

[Sanidhya's AHK latex-replacement project](https://github.com/notatyrannosaur/latex-replacements) ported to MacOS.

Sets up abbreviations for common symbols used in math.
The symbols available can be accessed using their LaTeX commands.

## Use on your MacOS Computer

1. Open System Preferences.app
2. Click on `Keyboard`
3. Switch to the `text` tab. If you have never edited this, you should see a list with a few default items
4. Simply drag the file `latex-replacments.plist` into this list

**Done!**

## Contributions

Thanks to [Sanidhya's AHK latex-replacement project](https://github.com/notatyrannosaur/latex-replacements) which motivated me to implement similar functionality on MacOS(since AHK doesn't run on mac).
Thanks [Aryaman Maithani](https://github.com/aryamanmaithani) for providing the latexshortcuts.txt file, which was modified to make this script!
