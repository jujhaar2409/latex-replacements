# latex-replacements
Sets up abbreviations for common symbols used in math.
The symbols available can be accessed using their LaTeX commands.

How to add your own shortcuts:
1. [Install AutoHotKey.](https://www.autohotkey.com/)
2. Edit the latex replacements.ahk file in any text editor.
3. Add your shortcuts in the format: `::<text to replace::<text it is replaced with>` to the end of the file.
4. Save your script.
5. (Optional) Right-click on your saved script and compile it to generate an exe for it.

There are a few shortcuts which have been commented out in the script, this is because their inclusion completely breaks the script.
